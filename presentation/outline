This is basically just an outline of what I'm seeing about presenting these things!

- Start by introducing ourselves!

	- who we are
	
	- what we do

- Start the discussion about what we've identified as the "problem"

	- initite the discussion by describing the "status quo" : IE this is the state of things as we see it!	

		- try and describe this as a story/narrative

			- try and make it personal, it helps to engage the audience : IE This is a problem I run into

	- REALLY make sure that we properly articulate that this IS a problem!

		- they have to believe that this is a problem otherwise there is no compelling reason for us to exist and more importantly, for them to give us $$$

	- Describe WHY we need money/support!
		
		- in our case we need to explain, not only what we could DO with funding, but also what we could do with their support

	- Don't get too caught up in messy unnecesary details!
		
		- Stick to the core issues! 
			
			- EFFICIENCY

			- convenience
		
			- speed
			
			- safety

	- Explain THAT this actually matters!
		
		- tell them why they care!

			- We are all going to be leaving here later today and it sure would be cool if we could doo that efficiently!

		- we're obviously the right people to do this!

			- I actually don't have one for this. we should discuss it!

		- It is already happening!

			- remember those ineffective "pick up points" that uber is using? 

				- it's good to point out the birth of a "market" it makes things look like a safer investment

- Now that we have described the status quo, and what problem has resulted from it, we can point out that "Oh Yeah!" we already have a solution for it!

	- here we can discuss our solution 
		
		- why it will work

		- how we can make $$

		- our experience 

		- why we can make this a reality!

			- maybe talk about our "proprietary" data metrics?
